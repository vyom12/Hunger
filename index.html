   <h1> Poverty and rising prices brought on by COVID-19 mean many families can't afford food. These knock-on effects of the pandemic, plus conflict, and the climate crisis, together are creating a “perfect storm” threatening more droughts and food shortages.

Save the Children is working alongside communities to provide life-changing assistance to children. Our hunger and nutrition programmes help millions every year. But we can’t do it alone.

Your gift is urgently needed for these children and their families. Please give to this emergency to allow us to respond where the need is greatest. Your donation could help us fight hunger in one of the worst-affected countries in the world, or support children wherever they need our help the most.</h1>
